# AlzSafe
Project related to Kainos AppCamp competition https://www.facebook.com/appcamp.polska

In 2015 I was finalist in iOS application development competition. The idea of the competition was to create an Apple Watch medical application using Swift language. Here is movie from the workshops. To have some record of this event I will use this repository for files related to the project that could be shared.

## Project

Application AlzSafe is directed at elderly people with Alzheimer`s disease and dementia. The insipration for the app was a movie [Still Alice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3316960/) where A linguistics professor and her family find their bonds tested when she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.

### AlzSafe What it is?
Application AlzSafe is directed at elderly people with Alzheimer`s disease and dementia. This app takes weight of shoulders and gives sense of freedom for people in such condition by notifying them  who they are.

Alzsafe is also a mapping application that lets you easily locate a person or receive alerts when they moved beyond a pre-set zone. It doesn`t need any additional center. It`s flexible and by flexible I mean that the app is easily configurable.

### How it works:

Imagine protoGrand called John, he`s 66. John have Alzheimer`s disease and he has attendant. Attendant takes care of John everyday, but sometimes John disappears for long hours, he likes to exercise alone. So attendant equips John with phone and watch each morning. John goes outside his home and doesn`t take phone calls, but he`s got Alzsafe app on phone. 

When John will be too long too far from safe location for example 15 minutes, watch will send him a bunch of notifications with proper information about him with option to call the rescue contact. After 30 minutes attendant with Alzsafe app on phone will be also notified about Johns location. If John notice the notification he can read info about him and choose to alarm attendant by calling him or tap the notification to open the app, this action will stop incoming notifications and the whole process of notifying will be repeated after another 15 minutes.

### How it looks:

Main task of my app is to notify user who he is but in order to do so attendant or user himself have to provide some data. For providing the data we need iPhone application. After launching the application we will see login screen with option to choose correct user type. After choosing user with Alzheimer type we will see short tutorial on how to use the application. Next we have to set the data of user. We have to set information about the user which are name surname address, set information about rescue contact like phone number and name of our rescue contact. One of the most important steps in setup is to set the safe location of the user. 

We have also additional options which are important but they are setted automatically but by editing them we can customize notifying system to personal needs. After we setted everything up we can go to main screen of users app and start monitoring the user, app goes in background and we can feel safe.
And here we see what will happen after opening the notification not on watch but on phone. So in the scenario where watch battery drained and somebody finds the person with  Alzheimer and is concerned about persons behavior, takes phone out of his pocket, opens the notification and see all needed data to contact with emergency.

The most important screen for app is notification screen, but after launching the app on watch we will see info about user and here in center is the main screen. in the left corner we have notification screen and on the right corner we have glance screen, short look with all needed information. and Now you can see notification in action. In the iphone app when user logs in to the carer user and as a carer we can add up to two persons with Alzheimer. After adding we are able to see last location of the user and information about the distance from the safe location and we can sent this person a message. Additionally attendant also have watch app so he can access all the data on watch too.
